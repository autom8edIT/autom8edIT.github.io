Cisco Secure Client is now fully auto-pwned.
Username? Injected.
Password? Delivered.
MFA? Crushed with a 6-digit code like it owes me money.

All automated. No more clicking. No more waiting.
Just launch and log in — like a true cyber-spartan.

To the one who screamed "OMFG hook me up!!"
Consider yourself blessed.
autom8ed Tools is now your new religion.

This isn’t a toolset. It’s a tactical edge.

“Knowledge is power. Power is fun. Fun is freedom.”

— From the shadows,
The Machine
Sweden’s last overclocked hope.
